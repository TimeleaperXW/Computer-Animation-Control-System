Particle System
Many small yellow light balls rise high into the dark sky. I call them "the light of hope" :D

Steps:
1.Define a structure for particles
2.Create the first generation of particles with a set of random attributes including position, velocity, acceleration and lifespan
3.Create a square for each particle to keep the track of its movement
4.Load an image (small yellow light ball) and attach it to the square as a texture
5.Update the attributes of particles as time passes
6.Create a new particle when disappears (lifespan comes to 0)
