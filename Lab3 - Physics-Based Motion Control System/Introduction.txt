Physics-Based Motion Control System
Steps:
1.Generation 20 balls using given coordinates and velocity
2.Make collision detection for each ball with the floor and every other ball
3.Calculate new velocity to replace the original one after collision
4.Update the coordinates and velocity as time passes
