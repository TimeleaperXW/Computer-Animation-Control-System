Behavioral Motion Control System
Steps:
1.Create a leader unit with given coordinate and type of spline
2.Create other units that make up the boids with given coordinates

3.Calculate the velocity for the boids according to the 4 rules of behavior
  i)follow
  ii)group up
  iii)avoid collision
  iv)parallel
4.Update the coordinates and volecity of the boids
